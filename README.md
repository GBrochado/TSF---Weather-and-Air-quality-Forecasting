## Weather and Air Quality Forecasting in Porto
Assignment on the course Time Series and Forecasting (MSc in Artificial Intelligence 2st year, 1st semester)

## A little context
### Overview
This project analyses and models a 5-year hourly time series containing meteorological and air-quality data for Porto, Portugal (20/11/2020 – 20/11/2025).
The main objective is to forecast temperature and PM2.5 concentrations using statistical time-series models.

The study follows all required steps in a classical forecasting workflow, including exploratory analysis, stationarity testing, model building, diagnostics, forecasting, and cross-validation.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains 43,824 hourly observations retrieved from the Open-Meteo Weather API and Air Quality API.
It includes variables such as:

- Meteorology: temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation, pressure, cloud cover, radiation
- Air quality: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃, CO, SO₂
- Other indices: UV index, aerosol optical depth

The dataset is synchronized by timestamp and pre-processed to ensure consistency.
